## 1x, 2x and 3x displays

**1x** is for low-resolution screens, the ones with the big, chunky pixels. The only low-resolution devices that can run iOS 9 are the iPad 2 and iPad mini. All iPhone models with 1x screens, such as the 3GS, are too old to bother with.

**2x** is for high-resolution Retina screens. This covers the iPhone 4S, the iPhone 5, 5c and 5s, the new iPhone 6, and all Retina iPads. Retina images are twice as big as the low-res images, hence the 2x.

**3x** is for the super high-resolution Retina HD screen of the *iPhone 6 Plus*. If you want your app to have extra sharp images on the top-of-the-line iPhone model, then you can drop them in this slot.

There is a special naming convention for image files. If the filename ends in **@2x** or **@3x** then that’s considered the Retina or Retina HD version. Low- resolution 1x images have no special name (you don’t have to write @1x).

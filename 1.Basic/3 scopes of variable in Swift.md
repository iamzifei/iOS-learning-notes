## 3 scopes of variable in Swift

* **Global scope**. These objects exist for the duration of the app and are accessable from anywhere
* **Instance scope**. These objects are alive for as long as the object that owns them stays alive.
* **Local scope**. only exist for the duration of that method. As soon as the execution of the program leaves this method, the local objects are no longer accessible.

##Info.plist

Most of the options from the Project Settings screen, such as the supported device orientations and whether the status bar is visible during launch, get stored in your app’s Info.plist file.

>Info.plist is a configuration file inside the application bundle that tells iOS how the app will behave.  
>
>It also describes certain characteristics of the app that don’t really fit anywhere else, such as its version number.
